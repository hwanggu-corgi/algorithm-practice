# goal: The goal is to set the maximum number of flags on the peaks, according to certain rules.

# Example
#   1)
#       A[0] = 1
#       A[1] = 5    <- peak 1
#       A[2] = 3
#       A[3] = 4    <- peak 2
#       A[4] = 3
#       A[5] = 4    <- peak 3
#       A[6] = 1
#       A[7] = 2
#       A[8] = 3
#       A[9] = 4
#       A[10] = 6   <- peak 4
#       A[11] = 2
