# goal: The goal is to count the number of chocolates that you will eat, following
# the above rules.

# - You begin with eating chocolate number 0.
# -  if you ate chocolate number X, then you will next eat the chocolate with number
# (X + M) modulo N (remainder of division).
# - You stop eating when you encounter an empty wrapper.

# Example
#   1) N = 10   M = 4
#       0, 4, 8, 2 ,6

# Pseudocode
# while chocolate to eat is not in set
# add chocolate to set
# shift chocolate by M

def solution(N, M):
    # write your code in Python 3.6

    pass
