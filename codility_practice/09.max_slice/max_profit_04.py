# Goal: Write a function, def solution(A) that, given an array A consisting of
# N integers containing daily prices of a stock share for a period of N consecutive
# days, returns the maximum possible profit from one transaction during this period

def solution(A):
    # write your code in Python 3.6

    for a in A:
        # calculate the net benefit after selling with price A

        # if the net price is positive
        # keep updating the max slice

        # if the net price is negative
    pass
