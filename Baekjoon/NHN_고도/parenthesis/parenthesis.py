#Goal:
#   - Write a program that convert the C expression into the ICPC expression
#       - Is where pairs of parentheses should be used exactly as needed
#       -  uses following symbols (+, -, *, /, and %)
#   - If the expression is not an error in ICPC, then it should not be an error in C
#   - Once it is not an error in C, the usage of parentheses should be checked to determine whether it is a proper expression in ICPC or not.
#   - If the expression is not properly parenthesized, i.e., the number of parentheses is not exact as needed, then it is considered improper
#   - The line should contain one of the following words:
#       - error
#           - if the input C expression is erroneous
#       - proper
#           - print proper if it is parenthesized properly with the exact number
#              of parentheses needed for ICPC
#       - improper.
#           - print if not proper
