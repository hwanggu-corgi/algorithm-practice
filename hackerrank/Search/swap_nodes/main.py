# Goal:
#  Complete the swapNodes function in the editor below. It should return a
#  two-dimensional array where each element is an array of integers representing
#  the node indices of an in-order traversal after a swap operation.

# Input
#   - indexes: an array of integers representing index values of each node[i], beginning with node[1] , the first element, as the root.
#   - queries: an array of integers, each representing a k value.

# Output
#   - For each k, perform the swap operation and store the indices of your in-order
#   traversal to your result array. After all swap operations have been performed,
#   return your result array for printing.


# Note
#   - -1 represents a null node



def swapNodes(indexes, queries):
    # construct trees

    # swap

    # print output
